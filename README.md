# login_notification.sh

This code is a simple bash script that uses the tail and grep commands to watch a log file for login and logout events.
Whenever it detects such an event, it uses the mail command to send an email notification to a specified email address. 
The script is designed to be run on a Linux server, and it assumes that the tail, grep, and mail commands are available on the system.
It also assumes that the log file being monitored is located at /var/log/auth.log, but this can be changed by modifying the LOG_FILE variable in the script.
